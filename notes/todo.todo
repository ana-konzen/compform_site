@nikki- open graph images https://www.opengraph.xyz/

â–¡ update sass (deprecations on imports)

- jslab/show
  - internal layout responsive
  - look at jsshow in context, should it center?

- js
  .- audit and fix
  - bring glider in to project off cdn

- css new
  - figma
    .- new carousel
    .- spoiler

  - cover needs new design for course material
  - class notes pages css are borked!

- get rid of {caption} modifier?

- css improve
  - overline h6s go from 10px to 12?
  - new look for the boxed linkes
  - the spoiler is a little lame, but i don't want to put markup for the spoiler box in the md. maybe an 11ty component, maybe web component.
  - update coding challenges difficulty bullets don't have the gray ghosts
  - use variables for column and sidebar widths and breakpoints
  - pre/code
    - pre/code is kind of weird anyway. negative margin hack?
      - its seems to be working. low priority


- eleventy
  - maybe move the 20xx folders into a `course` or `plan` subfolder. just break the urls! probably not referenced much
    - https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/

  - maybe switch classy for https://github.com/arve0/markdown-it-attrs (so fenced codeblocks can be classed up)


- markdown
  - scrub ":::" still being used on plan pages, etc
  - scrub {bigger} and {biggest} from md

# bugs
- classy seems to be eating space after last link in paragraph on intro toc


### phase 1

- jslab - maybe redo jslab with lessons from smudgejs.org?
